# SQL-database-clone-

Getting started: In this project, I have created a clone of the SQlite database in C from scratch. It has a simple SQL compiler and a virtual machine. The project also contains the use of the B-trees(Balanced trees) for searching and inserting of the data in the database.

Software used: Microsoft Visual Studio
